Dataset Strategy for Grayscale Leaf Images

1. Objective

This dataset consists of grayscale leaf images collected from various plants and trees growing on the MBMU campus. The dataset is structured to train a deep autoencoder for reconstructing leaf images.

2. Dataset Collection

    2.1 Identification
    Survey the MBMU campus to identify all plant/tree species.
    Document the scientific and common names for metadata purposes.

    2.2 Image Collection
    Capture high-resolution images of leaves from different plants/trees in ratio 1:1 and capture images on the white paper.
    Ensure variations in size, orientation, and texture.
    Maintain diverse lighting conditions while avoiding extreme shadows and overexposure.
    Capture images from multiple angles to improve dataset diversity.

    2.3 Labeling & Organization
    Assign unique identifiers and metadata (species name, collection date).
    Organize images into the following structure:
        plaintext
        Copy
        Edit
        Dataset/
        Plant_1/
            leaf1.jpg
            leaf2.jpg
        Plant_2/
            leaf1.jpg
        Include a metadata.csv file containing:
            Image name
            Plant species
            Collection details

3. Preprocessing

    3.1 Conversion to Grayscale
    Convert all images to grayscale to remove color dependency.

    3.2 Resizing
    Resize all images to a uniform dimension (e.g., 128x128 or 256x256 pixels).

    3.3 Normalization
    Normalize pixel values to the range [0, 1] for stable training.

    3.4 Data Augmentation
    Apply augmentation techniques to enhance dataset diversity:

    Rotation (±15 degrees)
    Horizontal and vertical flipping
    Scaling
    Noise addition
    3.5 Quality Check
    Ensure all images meet quality standards (no corruption or extreme distortions).

4. Dataset Splitting

Training Set (80%) – Used for model training.
Validation Set (10%) – Used for tuning and early stopping.
Test Set (10%) – Used for final evaluation.

5. Submission Format

    5.1 Dataset Files
    Structured directory with organized images.
    metadata.csv file for image details.

    5.2 Preprocessing Code
